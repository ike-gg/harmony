## About The Project

Harmony is an application that allows users to browse music-related content, including albums, songs, artists, and music videos.

It is built using the Apple Music Kit API and is completely free to use, offering only 30-second song previews.

The app also provides the ability to save items to a personal library for easy access later on.
